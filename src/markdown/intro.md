# Introduction

I wrote EASE UI for study purposes. It's a UI library based on Vue 3 and
Typescript.

The process of writing this UI library was a great learning experience for
me. All the design and implementation decisions are made based on my
experience as a web developer. Everything was written by myself, including
this documentation website, and I tried to avoid using other libraries and
dependencies as much as I could. Therefore, I don't really recommend using
this UI library in production.

However, if you wanted to checkout the source code, then you're most
definitely in the right place. All the source code is stored in a public
repository, here's the link: https://github.com/L-Qichen/ease-UI. The
history commit information shows very clearly what I have done, and you
can view them one by one in commit order. You can also view the source
code and examples for each component directly and run the project
following the steps described in README.md.
